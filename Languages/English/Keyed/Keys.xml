	<RG_ScribbledNote1>Too late, offworlders. The treasure is gone, and so are we. Also, your door code was embarrassingly easy to guess.</RG_ScribbledNote1>
	<RG_ScribbledNote2>I needed it more than you. By the time you read this, I’ll be light-years away, probably drunk on fermented space cactus.</RG_ScribbledNote2>
	<RG_ScribbledNote3>You were warned. Next time, maybe guard your ancient tech with more than a single dead rat and a rusty turret.</RG_ScribbledNote3>
	<RG_ScribbledNote4>This isn't a trap. Seriously. Definitely not booby-trapped. Why are you still reading this?</RG_ScribbledNote4>
	<RG_ScribbledNote5>I borrowed the artifact. You’ll get it back once I’m done not being vaporized by angry Goa'uld.</RG_ScribbledNote5>
	<RG_ScribbledNote6>Found it first. Claimed salvage rights. May or may not be cursed. Good luck.</RG_ScribbledNote6>
	<RG_ScribbledNote7>Leave now if you value your organs. The last guy who opened the crate got hugged...Permanently.</RG_ScribbledNote7>
	<RG_ScribbledNote8>Sorry, no loot today. I sold it for a shiny rock and half a sandwich. No regrets.</RG_ScribbledNote8>
	<RG_ScribbledNote9>By the time you decrypt this, I’ll be in orbit. Or dead. Depends on how angry my partner is.</RG_ScribbledNote9>
	<RG_ScribbledNote10>This note is all that remains. The rest is stashed in a Dwarfgate buffer... somewhere. Enjoy your scavenger hunt.</RG_ScribbledNote10>
	<RG_ScribbledNote11>If you're reading this, the trap didn't work. Again. I really need better bait than empty promises and ancient tech.</RG_ScribbledNote11>
	<RG_ScribbledNote12>The crate was full of bugs. Literal ones. I took the good stuff and left the infestation as a gift. You're welcome.</RG_ScribbledNote12>
	<RG_ScribbledNote13>Technically, this was never your loot. It belonged to the Ancients. I’m just doing my part to return it to their hidden stash. Somewhere. Probably.</RG_ScribbledNote13>
	<RG_ScribbledNote14>Someone came. I left. If you find anything useful, it's probably a trap. Or my leftover lunch. Don't mix them up.</RG_ScribbledNote14>
	<RG_ScribbledNote15>Glorious treasure was here. I remembered how much I hate sharing but felt I needed to leave something. Enjoy this commemorative piece of disappointment.</RG_ScribbledNote15>
