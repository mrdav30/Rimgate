	<RG_AnalysisCatastrophicText>Something went terribly wrong during the analysis. Energy readings spiked beyond containment thresholds, and the artifact destabilized before any useful data could be recovered. All collected telemetry has collapsed into incoherent noise.\n\nThe team learned nothing — except perhaps when to start running sooner.</RG_AnalysisCatastrophicText>

	<!-- Notes -->

	<RG_ScribbledNote1>Too late, offworlders. The treasure is gone, and so are we. Also, your door code was embarrassingly easy to guess.</RG_ScribbledNote1>
	<RG_ScribbledNote2>I needed it more than you. By the time you read this, I’ll be light-years away, probably drunk on fermented space cactus.</RG_ScribbledNote2>
	<RG_ScribbledNote3>You were warned. Next time, maybe guard your ancient tech with more than a single dead rat and a rusty turret.</RG_ScribbledNote3>
	<RG_ScribbledNote4>This isn't a trap. Seriously. Definitely not booby-trapped. Why are you still reading this?</RG_ScribbledNote4>
	<RG_ScribbledNote5>I borrowed the artifact. You’ll get it back once I’m done not being vaporized by angry Goa'uld.</RG_ScribbledNote5>
	<RG_ScribbledNote6>Found it first. Claimed salvage rights. May or may not be cursed. Good luck.</RG_ScribbledNote6>
	<RG_ScribbledNote7>Leave now if you value your organs. The last guy who opened the crate got hugged...Permanently.</RG_ScribbledNote7>
	<RG_ScribbledNote8>Sorry, no loot today. I sold it for a shiny rock and half a sandwich. No regrets.</RG_ScribbledNote8>
	<RG_ScribbledNote9>By the time you decrypt this, I’ll be in orbit. Or dead. Depends on how angry my partner is.</RG_ScribbledNote9>
	<RG_ScribbledNote10>This note is all that remains. The rest is stashed in a Dwarfgate buffer... somewhere. Enjoy your scavenger hunt.</RG_ScribbledNote10>
	<RG_ScribbledNote11>If you're reading this, the trap didn't work. Again. I really need better bait than empty promises and ancient tech.</RG_ScribbledNote11>
	<RG_ScribbledNote12>The crate was full of bugs. Literal ones. I took the good stuff and left the infestation as a gift. You're welcome.</RG_ScribbledNote12>
	<RG_ScribbledNote13>Technically, this was never your loot. It belonged to the Ancients. I’m just doing my part to return it to their hidden stash. Somewhere. Probably.</RG_ScribbledNote13>
	<RG_ScribbledNote14>Someone came. I left. If you find anything useful, it's probably a trap. Or my leftover lunch. Don't mix them up.</RG_ScribbledNote14>
	<RG_ScribbledNote15>Glorious treasure was here. I remembered how much I hate sharing but felt I needed to leave something. Enjoy this commemorative piece of disappointment.</RG_ScribbledNote15>
