# Rimgate #

Rimgate is a large-scale Stargate-inspired expansion for RimWorld, introducing an ancient planetary gate network, alien technologies, and faction-driven conflict centered around mysterious Dwarfgates.

Unlike traditional Stargate interpretations, this mod reimagines gate technology as a sealed planetary lattice integrated directly into the RimWorld universe. Dwarfgates are relic constructs—smaller, dimmer cousins of myth—left scattered across the Rim for unknown reasons.

Players can discover, study, control, and weaponize this technology while navigating escalating tensions between factions drawn to its power.
